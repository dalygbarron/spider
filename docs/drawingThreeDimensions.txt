so we need to find the place on the screen that we are meant to draw these 3d
thingies, then we find if it is a real place and if it is then we draw it.

The things that we need to draw are lindels, entity instances, and nodes and
lines. Nodes and lines would probably be covered by different code though since
they need to have lines and shiet, so yeah for them I will just update the
spheremesh function o nthe renderer.

That leaves drawing lindels and entity instances. These cases are both
basically the same thing, you just pass the rat, the position in 3d space, the
rotation, the scale, and the camera/projection matrix and it will place it upon
the screen. I don't think that there is anything more to it than that.

Right now neither entities or lindels are animated, but I would like for
entities to be animated, so I guess I will need a version for both. Well
lindels are a feature of the future so just have the one version for now.

Yes so we need a draw sphere mesh function, a draw sphere node function, and
a draw 3d sprite function which takes a rat.

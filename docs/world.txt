yeah so the window is needed to initialise those thingies I think because
otherwise it does not know what context it is creating them in I think. So that
they can also hypothetically switch to different screens it will have to keep
track of whether it is initialised, and also keep track of the reference of the
screen it was initialised to and when there is a different screen to what it
had before or it's the first one then it reinitialises. Yes. If you swap
screens that would cause a leak of GPU memory though which kind of sucks. No
maybe when it switches it can go and take it off the old one yeah it probably
can hopefully. I mean it's kinda academic because I don't intend to have
multiple screens showing the same thing or even multiple screens at all.

Real mouse needs to be captured and kept in the cetre at all times unless the
game has lost focus or whatever. Should also be able to control the position of
the virtual mouse so that it can be set into the centre too which allows the
first person view.

This means that displaying the "cursor" is dissassociated from the actual
position of the mouse itself but that is ok, it will be shown where it should
be shown for the given screen.

Also, this means that knobs will need to have the position of the mouse cursor
passed to them Oh but they already do so no change.

Control of the mouse object will be in the core which is fine since screens
have access to the core and screens are where the mouse position is
manipulated.

One day in the future I may wish to add gamepad support which would require
manipulating the position of the cursor. This would happen in... a screen, yeah
so that is fine too.

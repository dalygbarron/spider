Behaviour
===============================================================================

Alright I have implemented most of the crap that is needed to get behaviours
onto the lindels that should be executing them, but I do not really know how
the behaviours should actually act, and what the boundary is between behaviours
and what they innately do due to physics or whatever so I shall now decide what
these should be.

Gravity should be innate and not related to entity behaviour, as should
stoppign when they hit the ground, how much things bounce off the ground
/ float in it / sink. I think buoyancy is related to both the density of the
fluid and the weight of the thingy so the entity should define the weight.

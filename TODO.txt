Animated Sprites in Adventure Screen
    Yep should have animated sprites. Can either be controlled by script or
    autolooping animations that play as soon as you enter the level.

Make sure bullet and actor ids start at 1 not 0
    Yeah I need 0 to represent no valid bullet so there must not be anything
    with id 0 or it will screw up.

Invalid level file causes segfault
    Program should not segfault in any circumstances. Same thing when passing
    a battle script too.

Set Origin in EntityScreen
    Yeah I forgot to do that last time so I need to do it now.

EntityScreen zooming
    Make it that the zoom centres around the current middle of the screen.
    Also make it that the mesh vertex selection zone doesn't get bigger when
    zoom.

Boating screen
    Yeah so the boating screen is a special kind of adventure screen where you
    can also have things moving around in 3d behind the photosphere as well as
    a floor and sky which are drawn with a shader.
    So in order to enable the boating screen, you will just need to call some
    kind of script endpoint 

Alt text on buttons
    Yeah so far have been too lazy but it should be easy enough to do and thus
    I ough to do it. It will not be word wrapped, it will just write exactly
    what is there. It's important because the inventory kinda needs it.

Build for all platforms
    Need to figure out an automatic way of building for linux, mac, and windows
    at the same time. Also test it works on windows since that will be freaky.

Put save files in home
    This is necessary because otherwise when they update their save file will
    be lost, and they need to be able to update.

Screen where you can browse files and choose to edit entities or levels
    Maybe also let them edit the general config here but I am not sure I will
    allow that as it is complicated. Actually it would be doable, but yeah nah
    why bother.

Improve core parsing core
    It sucks ASS. Actually also generally improve all the FileIO code to have
    less of the same stuff over and over.

Hotkeys for buttons
    Yeah would be nice for example to make it that the exit inventory button
    can be activated by pressing escape. The hotkey is the only way because of
    the fact that gui stuff is running in it's own screen. Would also be nice
    for knob based puzzles.

Look into making the projection better fit with the equirectangular shader
    Or vice versa, but it will at some point be necessary that they rightly
    match each other. Possibly I could write my own equirectangular thing
    projector, but I might have trouble doing the rotation part.

Remove ghc::filesystem when c++17 is better supported
    Yes do that, dunno when that is gonna be doable though.

Make it so the same sound can't be played twice in one frame.
    It sounds loud and annoying. Should be disabled. I don't really know any
    way to do this without looping for each sound player and checking what it's
    playing and when it started playing it which kinda sucks.
    Maybe instead I could just make it that if two sounds have the same
    priority, normally the newer one will take over, but not if it is still the
    same frame that that one started in.

Indicate FPS on battle screen
    Yeah it is necessary to show the frame rate so people can't cheat, but it
    seems kinda wasteful to convert the FPS to a string every frame.
    THen again, does it really stop cheating anyway??

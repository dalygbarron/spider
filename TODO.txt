Properly Playable Level Screen with items and shit.
    Yep like it says right there.

Battle Screen
    Should run entirely off a Lua script, and you should be able to start the
    engine by specifying just the game file and a battle script. Make a nice
    little test battle.

Animated Sprites in Battle Screen
    Yep should have animated sprites which are only controlled by script.

Animated Sprites in Adventure Screen
    Yep should have animated sprites. Can either be controlled by script or
    autolooping animations that play as soon as you enter the level.

Invalid level file causes segfault
    Program should not segfault in any circumstances.

Improve core parsing core
    It sucks ASS. Actually also generally improve all the FileIO code to have
    less of the same stuff over and over.

Set Origin in EntityScreen
    Yeah I forgot to do that last time so I need to do it now.

EntityScreen zooming
    Make it that the zoom centres around the current middle of the screen.
    Also make it that the mesh vertex selection zone doesn't get bigger when
    zoom.

Screen where you can browse files and choose to edit entities or levels
    Maybe also let them edit the general config here but I am not sure I will
    allow that as it is complicated. Actually it would be doable, but yeah nah
    why bother.

Alt text on buttons
    Yeah so far have been too lazy but it should be easy enough to do and thus
    I ough to do it. It will not be word wrapped, it will just write exactly
    what is there.

Hotkeys for buttons
    Yeah would be nice for example to make it that the exit inventory button
    can be activated by pressing escape. The hotkey is the only way because of
    the fact that gui stuff is running in it's own screen.

Coloured Text
    Yeah should be able to use the font to draw text in any colour probably.

Look into making the projection better fit with the equirectangular shader
    Or vice versa, but it will at some point be necessary that they rightly
    match each other. Possibly I could write my own equirectangular thing
    projector, but I might have trouble doing the rotation part.

Remove ghc::filesystem when c++17 is better supported
    Yes do that, dunno when that is gonna be doable though.

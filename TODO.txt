Level Screen
    Must be able to set the background and pan around in 3d, entities must
    place themselves in the 3d joint and also rotate thus that it looks right,
    which also means I need to figure that out. Should be able to select entity
    files to add into the level

Make interface to 3D rotation be as latlong
    Yeah so currently it uses a couple of trigonometric functions in order to
    rotate points, and it's kinda slow. This is only really necessary for the
    rotation around the X axis, rotation on the Y axis can be done simply by
    adding to the longitude. So therefore, I say we just pass latlongs to the
    rotate function instead of a 3d point, then do the conversion to 3D point
    for the rotation around X, then convert back to latitude and longitude and
    add the rotation around Y at the same time.

Optimise 3D Projection
    My 3D projection for entities at the current time is quite inefficient
    which is not a good thing. For a start, we could decrease the number of
    trigonometric functions that need to be called by making it that rotation
    operates around the x axis, and then rotating around the x axis simply by
    adding the rotation to the longitude while it is in that form.

Set Origin in EntityScreen
    Yeah I forgot to do that last time so I need to do it now.

Look into built in text editor
    Would be handy to have for level screen but I am not sure how hard it would
    be to get it to work so maybe no.

game gui
    Should be ripped off from the gui I developed for snowpea, that was great.
    Won't support keyboard only or gamepad but who gives a fuck? Not me. Text
    will be implemented with sf::Text so that I can do wrapping without too
    much pain.

Playable Level Screen
    To start off we just need to have the screen and make it that it follows
    the mouse. Make sure that it can handle having GUI elements that make the
    camera stop following the mouse until they go away.

Scripting
    Will need to embed a scripting language, and then make it able to drive the
    gui, and move the camera around and stuff.
    Should be able to implement a basic main menu that leads into another
    screen when you press the play button.

Properly Playable Level Screen with items and shit.
    Yep like it says right there.

Battle Screen
    Should run entirely off a Lua script, and you should be able to start the
    engine by specifying just the game file and a battle script. Make a nice
    little test battle.

Improve core parsing core
    It sucks ASS. Actually also generally improve all the FileIO code to have
    less of the same stuff over and over.

EntityScreen zooming
    Make it that the zoom centres around the current middle of the screen.
    Also make it that the mesh vertex selection zone doesn't get bigger when
    zoom.

Go to EntityScreen from LevelScreen and back again
    Really should be able to go to the entityscreen from the level screen so
    that you can edit some entity if you so desire.

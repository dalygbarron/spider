I am starting to think that a repository class is not actually necessary for
this program or for the game itself. Let us think about this.

TextureRepository: this is not needed because the level textures will be
massive and should not reside in memory the whole time. On the other hand, all
other textures will be in a single sprite sheet which is one texture. So no
need for saving textures at all.

RatPackRepository: only one in the game.

SoundRepository: We probably should cache sounds even if we are not handing out
references to them everywhere.

EntityRepository: We should indeed have this one, also the level repository
will have a dependency on it since they contain instances which are references
to entities.

LevelRepository: could be useful actually. What we could do is rather than
returning immutable references, we should return mutable copies. Well, or just
return immutable references and let people make their own copy.

Ok well the end of the story is we actually should have repositories. :(
